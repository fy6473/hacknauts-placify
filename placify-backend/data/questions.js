    options: ['18 seconds', '20 seconds', '25 seconds', '30 seconds'],
    correctAnswer: '18 seconds',
    explanation: 'Total distance = 100 + 200 = 300m. Speed = 60 km/h = 60 * 1000/3600 = 16.67 m/s. Time = 300/16.67 = 18 seconds',

    correctAnswer: '12',
    explanation: '(2^10 + 2^9) / 2^8 = (1024 + 512) / 256 = 1536 / 256 = 6. Wait, let me recalculate: 2^10/2^8 + 2^9/2^8 = 2^2 + 2^1 = 4 + 2 = 6',

    correctAnswer: '20%',
    explanation: 'Marked Price = 1500, Discount = 20% of 1500 = 300, Selling Price = 1500 - 300 = 1200. Profit = 1200 - 1000 = 200. Profit % = (200/1000)*100 = 20%',
